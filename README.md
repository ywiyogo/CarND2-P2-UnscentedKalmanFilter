# Unscented Kalman Filter Project Starter Code
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

---

## Writeup
This project describes the application of the constant turn rate and velocity magnitude model (CTRV) and the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). This project is written in C++. For the given measurements data with lidar dan radar, the RMSE returns [
0.0771442 0.0852696 0.387216 0.250489].

The figure below shows the result of the UKF state estimation compared to the ground truth and its normalized innovation squared (NIS) calculation:

## Dependencies

* cmake >= v3.5
* make >= v4.1
* gcc/g++ >= v5.4

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./UnscentedKF path/to/input.txt path/to/output.txt`. You can find
   some sample inputs in 'data/'.
    - eg. `./UnscentedKF ../data/obj_pose-laser-radar-synthetic-input.txt`

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) as much as possible.

## Generating Additional Data

This is optional!

If you'd like to generate your own radar and lidar data, see the
[utilities repo](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Mercedes-SF-Utilities) for
Matlab scripts that can generate additional data.
